You are tasked with optimizing the following code to improve its performance. This involves reducing latency, reducing CPU cycles, minimizing memory access, and optimizing I/O operations. Please follow these steps and guidelines:

Task Instructions:
- Analyze the code: Examine the provided code in detail.
- Analyze the optimization patterns:
    - The provided optimization patterns were deemed applicable to the code, consider them when generating optimization strategies.
- Identify optimization opportunities, determine where you can:
    - Reduce or eliminate nested loops to lower computational overhead.
    - Select more efficient data structures to minimize memory access and improve performance.
    - Apply dynamic programming or memoization to avoid redundant calculations and reduce CPU usage where applicable.
    - Implement specialized algorithms if they can significantly improve performance.
    - Optimize I/O operations to reduce their impact on overall performance.
- Suggest optimization strategies: Propose multiple methods to improve performance. For each method:
    - Provide a detailed explanation of how the optimization improves performance.
    - Discuss the trade-offs in terms of complexity, maintainability, and performance gains.
- Choose the most effective optimization: After evaluating each proposed strategy, select the approach that yields the best balance of performance, readability, and maintainability.
- Implement the chosen optimization: Rewrite the code with the chosen optimization strategies, ensuring:
    - The optimized code produces the same output as the original code for all valid inputs.
- Output Requirements:
    - Begin with a step-by-step analysis of the original code and identify inefficiencies.
    - Outline each proposed optimization strategy in detail, including the reasoning behind it and its potential impact performance.
    - Implement the best optimization strategies directly into the code.
    - Ensure the final code is efficient, correct in terms of functionality, and maintains same output formatting.
    - Identify which optimization pattern, if any, influenced the implemented optimization strategies.

Here is an example of desirable response:
Example of cpp code to be optimized:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Inefficient code for finding duplicates in a vector of user IDs
vector<int> findDuplicates(const vector<int>& userIds) {
    vector<int> duplicates;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < userIds.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < userIds.size(); ++j) {
            if (userIds[i] == userIds[j]) {
                duplicates.push_back(userIds[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    return duplicates;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> userIds = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5};
    vector<int> duplicates = findDuplicates(userIds);

    cout << "Duplicate user IDs: ";
    for (int id : duplicates) {
        cout << id << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Example of Analysis:
Analysis and reasoning example:
    - Reduction of Nested Loops: Uses an O(nÂ²) approach with nested loops.
    - Efficient Data Structure Selection: Using an unordered_set to track seen user IDs reduces complexity to O(n).
    - Dynamic Programming or Memoization: Not required here as each ID is processed once with an efficient data structure.
    - Specialized Algorithms: Using hashing-based data structures effectively reduces redundant checks.
    - I/O Optimization: Minimal I/O operations are used. Keep output operations efficient and straightforward.
                
Here is the actual optimized code: 
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

// Optimized code for finding duplicates in a vector of user IDs
vector<int> findDuplicates(const vector<int>& userIds) {
    unordered_set<int> seen;  // Set to track seen user IDs
    unordered_set<int> duplicates;  // Set to store duplicates
    for (int id : userIds) {
        if (seen.find(id) != seen.end()) {
            duplicates.insert(id);  // Add to duplicates if already seen
        } else {
            seen.insert(id);  // Mark as seen
        }
    }
    return vector<int>(duplicates.begin(), duplicates.end());  // Convert set to vector
}

int main() {
    vector<int> userIds = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5};
    vector<int> duplicates = findDuplicates(userIds);

    cout << "Duplicate user IDs: ";
    for (int id : duplicates) {
        cout << id << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
